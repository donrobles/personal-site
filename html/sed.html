    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <div class="indent" id="content-Introduction">
        <p>
            I sat in front of my computer for the better part of an hour, trying to figure out how to start my
            introduction, until I decided to just start typing, and see where it goes.
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Don Robles, and if you’re here, I imagine you’d like to know more about me. Well, I’m happy to
            report you’ve come to the right place, after all, this is my website! I usually don’t take many things
            seriously (mainly myself), except for what needs serious attention (like myself), and I like to think this
            site will reflect that. Maybe. I’m not sure yet. Part of me wants it to focus solely on my skills,
            portraying me as a professional with desires to accomplish everything I set my mind to. The other part kinda
            just wants to finish this thing because it’s been on my to-do list for a more than a few years!</p>
        <p>
            In the end, both those tracks of thought convey who I am to a T (why is that a phrase? “To a T”?) because
            for
            better or worse I’m both those people, and without one of them, I wouldn’t be me1. I say that because my two
            greatest passions, thus far in my short life, are building things, and solving problems. These two joys are
            at the
            base of everything I deem worthwhile undertaking.
        </p>
        <p>
            These joys are my guide in what I do due to the nature of their interaction within myself. I want to solves
            problems like a coder, breaking them down into bite size pieces, addressing each of them until the full
            solution is implemented, while my desire to build and create influences how the problem is solved. I’d find
            myself pulling from my past experiences, building with previous code pieces I created, putting them together
            into a unique solution that would serve me again in the future.</p>
        <p>
            In layman’s terms, I’m a coder, and an artist. A professional, while being a silly guy, or as I like to put
            it, I’m a focused individual with a carefree personality. There was a time when I thought I had to drop one
            part of myself to focus solely on the other, but I’ve since learned they’re intrinsically linked to who I
            am, and I’m destined to continue the struggle of satiating both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mean, honestly, it’s not that hard, and I rather enjoy it too as it keeps life fresh for me. One day I’ll
            be in a bout of solving life’s greatest problems, while another I’m furiously scribbling away in my
            sketchbook. Maybe one day I’ll truly let one go (I doubt it), but until then, I know I’ll always have
            something to keep
            my days occupied!
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy what you learn about me! (I promise, I’m cooler in person!)
        </p>

    <h2>2. Hobbies/Interests</h2>
    <div class="indent" id="content-Hobbies-Interests">
        <p>
            I have a lot of interests, but really only 2 worth mentioning.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="indent">Drawing</h3>
    <div class="indent passage">
        <p>
            My obsession with drawing started out like anything else, a strong desire to get rid of my boredom. The
            boredom was due to being in a less-than-stimulating class my Freshman year of college. My professor
            droned on and on about a topic that did nothing for me personally, and in that state, with a need to
            avoid falling asleep, I began to doodle anything I could see in the class.
        </p>
        <p>
            It started with an outline of the ceiling projector, catching its curves as best as I can, and it
            progressed to outlining each connection available behind the projector. From there, I found my way
            upward, drawing the ceiling mount, and even further from there getting each ceiling tile. I kept at it,
            making sure to capture the perspective of my view of the projector as best I could, and before I knew
            it, the class was over.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a moment of awakening for me as I thought, “Why not take an art class?” realizing anything that
            could hold my attention the way drawing did, is at least worth looking into. After that, I took my first
            art class in the fall semester of my sophomore year, another the following spring, declared my Studio
            Art major at the end of the year, and have never looked back since.

            <li> PREAMBLE

                <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
                    functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
                    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
                    with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
                    Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
                    to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
                    for modifications made by others.
                </p>
                <p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
                    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
                    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
                    license designed for free software.
                </p>
                <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
                    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
                    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
                    software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
                    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
                    whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
                    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
                <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
                    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
                    distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
                    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
                    work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”, below,
                    refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
                    licensee, and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you
                    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
                    under copyright law.
                </p>
                <p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
                    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
                    modifications and/or translated into another language.
                </p>
                <p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
                    of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
                    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
                    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
                    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
                    part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
                    any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
                    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
                    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
                    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
                    that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
                    section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
                    allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
                    Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
                    Sections then there are none.
                </p>
                <p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
                    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
                    the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
                    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
                </p>
                <p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
                    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
                    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
                    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
                    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
                    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
                    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
                    to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
                    format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
                    or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
                    An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
                    of text. A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.
                </p>
                <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
                    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
                    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
                    DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
                    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples
                    of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
                    JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
                    read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
                    XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
                    not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
                    PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
                    output purposes only.
                </p>
                <p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
                    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
                    this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
                    formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
                    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title,
                    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
                </p>
                <p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
                    of the Document to the public.
                </p>
                <p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
                    title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
                    text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
                    specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
                    “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve the Title”
                    of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
                    section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.
                </p>
                <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
                    states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
                    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
                    License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
                    implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
                    no effect on the meaning of this License.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> VERBATIM COPYING

                <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
                    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
                    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
                    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
                    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
                    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
                    copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
                    compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
                    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
                </p>
                <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
                    you may publicly display copies.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

                <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
                    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
                    Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
                    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
                    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
                    the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
                    you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
                    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
                    visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
                    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
                    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
                    as verbatim copying in other respects.
                </p>
                <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
                    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
                    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
                    pages.
                </p>
                <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
                    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
                    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
                    a computer-network location from which the general network-using
                    public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
                    a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
                    If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
                    when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
                    that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
                    location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
                    Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
                    edition to the public.
                </p>
                <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
                    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
                    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> MODIFICATIONS

                <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
                    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
                    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
                    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
                    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
                    of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
                        from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
                        (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
                        of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
                        if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

                    </li>
                    <li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
                        responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
                        Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
                        Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
                        unless they release you from this requirement.

                    </li>
                    <li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
                        Modified Version, as the publisher.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

                    </li>
                    <li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
                        adjacent to the other copyright notices.

                    </li>
                    <li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
                        giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
                        terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
                        and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.

                    </li>
                    <li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
                        to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
                        publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
                        there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
                        stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
                        given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
                        Version as stated in the previous sentence.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
                        public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
                        the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
                        it was based on. These may be placed in the “History” section.
                        You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
                        least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
                        publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

                    </li>
                    <li> For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
                        the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
                        substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
                        dedications given therein.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
                        unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers
                        or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

                    </li>
                    <li> Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section
                        may not be included in the Modified Version.

                    </li>
                    <li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
                        to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
                    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
                    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
                    of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
                    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice.
                    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
                </p>
                <p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
                    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
                    parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
                    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
                    standard.
                </p>
                <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
                    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
                    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
                    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
                    through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
                    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
                    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
                    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
                    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
                </p>
                <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
                    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
                    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

                <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
                    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
                    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
                    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
                    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
                    license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
                </p>
                <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
                    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
                    copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
                    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
                    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
                    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
                    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
                    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
                </p>
                <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
                    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
                    “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
                    and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all
                    sections Entitled “Endorsements.”
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

                <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
                    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
                    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
                    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
                    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
                </p>
                <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
                    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
                    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
                    other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

                <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
                    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
                    distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
                    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
                    of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
                    When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
                    apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
                    derivative works of the Document.
                </p>
                <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
                    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
                    the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on
                    covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
                    electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
                    Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
                    aggregate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> TRANSLATION

                <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
                    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
                    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
                    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
                    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
                    original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
                    translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
                    Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
                    the original English version of this License and the original versions
                    of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
                    the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
                    or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
                </p>
                <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
                    “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
                    its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
                    title.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> TERMINATION

                <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
                    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
                    will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                </p>
                <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
                    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
                    unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
                    terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
                    fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
                    60 days after the cessation.
                </p>
                <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
                    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
                    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
                    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
                    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
                    your receipt of the notice.
                </p>
                <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
                    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
                    this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
                    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
                    not give you any rights to use it.

            <li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

                <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
                    of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
                    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
                    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
                    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
                    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
                    License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
                    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
                    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
                    Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
                    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
                    as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
                    specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
                    License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a
                    version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
                    Document.

            <li> RELICENSING

                <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
                    World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
                    provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
                    public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
                    “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
                    site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
                    site.
                </p>
                <p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
                    license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
                    corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
                    California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
                    published by that same organization.
                </p>
                <p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
                    in part, as part of another Document.
                </p>
                <p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
                    License, and if all works that were first published under this License
                    somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
                    or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
                    and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
                </p>
                <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
                    under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
                    provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        <h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

        <p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
            the License in the document and put the following copyright and
            license notices just after the title page:
        </p>
        <div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  Copyright (C)  <var>2018</var>  <var>Don Robles</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
            replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:
        </p>
        <div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
            combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
            situation.
        </p>
        <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
            recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
            free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
            to permit their use in free software.
