    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <div class="passage" id="content-Introduction">
        <p>
            I sat in front of my computer for roughly an hour, trying to write my
            introduction, until I decided to just start typing and let the thoughts flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Don Robles, and I already know you’re trying to learn more about me! Well, you’ve come to the
            right place! I don’t take many things seriously (mainly myself), except for serious matters (like myself),
            and hopefully this site reflects that! Maybe. I’m conflicted. I want to focus solely on my skills,
            portraying myself as a professional who accomplishes everything he sets his mind to. However, I also just
            want to finish this site because it’s been on the to-do list for several years!
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, both those trains of thought convey myself because, for better or worse, I’m a conflicted
            person, and without one of them, I wouldn’t be me. This is because my two great passions are building
            things, and solving problems, and it's these two joys that are at the base of everything I deem worthwhile
            undertaking.
        </p>
        <p>
            These joys guide me in what I do given the nature of their interaction within myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to solves problems like a coder, splitting them into bite-sized pieces, addressing each of them
            until the full solution is implemented, while my desire to build and create influences how the problem is
            solved. I’ve found myself pulling from past experiences to build new and unique solutions to serve me again
            in the future!
        </p>
        <p>
            In layman’s terms, I’m a coder, and an artist. A professional who enjoys being silly. Or as I like to put
            it, I’m a focused individual with a carefree personality. For a time I thought of dropping one part of
            myself to focus solely on the other, but I’ve since learned they’re both intrinsically linked to who I am,
            and I’m destined to continue struggling to satiate both of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Honestly, it’s not hard, and it keeps life fresh for me. One day I’ll be in a bout of solving life’s
            greatest problems, while another I’m furiously scribbling away in my sketchbook. Maybe one day I’ll truly
            let one go (I doubt it), but until then, I know I’ll always have something to keep my days occupied!
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy what you've learn about me! (I promise, I’m cooler in person!)
        </p>
        <p>

                Instagram is the social media site I use most frequently. Given I love to draw, I think it makes sense.
                I never post pics of myself at different outings (concerts, family visits, etc.), it's only ever the
                drawings I've completed.

                I have a LinkedIn, but I'm not active on the platform because I'm currently employed. I occasionally
                respond to messages, but that's the extent of my use of the site. I was definitely using it a lot while

                Dropr isn't a social media site, it's where I post high resolution photos of my drawings. If you don't

        <p>
            I've learned recently, since about 2014, I must always have a goal to work towards, otherwise I truly wont
            feel fulfilled with my time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following are some of my favorite accomplishments in my life thus far!
        </p>
        <a name="Authentic-Athens-Marathon"></a>
        <h3>Authentic Athens Marathon</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Have you ever ran a marathon? No? Good, because physically and mentally it taxed me more than anything
                before it (but run one if you're committed). The grueling experience taught me a new level of
                determination
                I had for accomplishing my goals, as it required every ounce of discipline (and then some) to keep my
                feet moving for what felt like an eternity!
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to the difficulty, my newfound understanding of my mental fortitude has allowed me to look
                on my problems since then and say, “This isn’t nearly as exhausting or hard, I can handle this.”
                And continue operating at a mental level I know I can sustain.
            </p>
            <p>
                When working out, I say <b>REALLY</b> mean things to myself, knowing the pain, soreness, and exhaustion
                is nothing in comparison, and I push myself harder. I doubt I’d run another marathon (maybe), but
                it was totally worth the effort and training required of me to complete it!
            </p>
            <p>
                And in case you’re wondering, I ran the <b>Authentic Marathon</b> in Greece on 11-12-16 with a time of
                5:05:48.

        <h3>An Ode To Dedication</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                In 2015, I was dispirited with my creative state-of-mind, and set out to rectify that. Prior to this
                project, I attempted a "200 Drawings In A Year" project, but failed at it because of the insurmountable
                creative barrier of running out of interesting ideas. From that experience, I learned I needed to feel
                connected to my drawings, I couldn't "just draw something", so this project addressed those issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time, graffiti art was an interesting format to me, so I knew I wanted to draw words. Next, I
                wrote a 52-word poem about the project, focused on the dedication required to complete it. Each
                of the 52 words would be drawn each week, for a year, so I’d have 52 drawings of words, making the poem,
                thus literally conveying the dedication required to complete the project itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                After setting the foundation, I started the project on April 27th, 2015 and kept doing a drawing a week,
                for about 4 weeks!! Falling behind was lame, but my determination never wavered, and after some life
                setbacks, I completed the final drawing on December 31st, 2016! It wasn't intentional to finish on the
                last day of 2016, but with the year ending, and only 2 drawings remaining at the time, I completely
                stopped everything to make sure I completed them before the year concluded.

                If you’re reading this, it means I finished building this site! (Seriously, this took forever!).
                Granted, over the years the image of my site went through several iterations, and technology changing
                also changed the effort required for building it, so I wasn't purely sitting on it over the years!
                Still, sitting down and really thinking of what this site was going to be, the look-and-feel, the
                functional requirements, where it would be hosted, etc, was all a truly unique learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                And like any learning experience, the time it took to build was SO. MUCH. MORE! Than I originally
                thought, and I already thought it'd take a long time! Though, working on 3 or 4 personal projects
                concurrently meant they’d take longer to finish, but that’s another learning experience I’ve been
                regularly taking into account since then.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I digress, I’m glad this site is done, and I hope you’ve enjoyed reading through it! I focused on
                making it light, that it loads quickly, and works on any device! But if you find an issue, contact me!

        <h3>Full Tough Mudder</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Doing a Tough Mudder was one of my more spontaneous decisions! It started simply when my friend posted
                on Facebook asking who wanted to do one? And never wanting to say “No” to life, I thought “Sure, why
                not?” and that was all my reasoning!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don't know, a “Tough Mudder” is a 10 mile obstacle course, with an obstacle at each half-mile,
                and each obstacle usually requires assistance to complete. Basically, the whole course focuses on using
                teamwork to get through it. I was on a team of 5 people, 3 of whom I never met before the event! (they
                were friends of friends)
            </p>
            <p>
                I trained for 3 months to be in proper condition to complete the 10 mile course, and I’m glad I did
                because while going through the event, I was slightly surprised at the “ease” of it. Not to say I had no
                help! I certainly did (some obstacles require it), but the physical toll on my body wasn’t nearly as
                draining as I was anticipating! (my one friend was worn out at the end!)
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it was because of my prior long distance training for my marathon, but it didn’t detract from
                my sense of accomplishment once I completed the event! If you decide to do one, I highly recommend
                having a team of friends do it with, that’s truly where the joy lies!

        <h3>Landing an Ollie</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Since I was a kid, I’ve admired skateboarding culture. I had a skateboard too, but that was my whole
                experience! Growing up, I’d watch guys doing tricks, envying how cool they looked (and they still look
                cool). I watched skateboarding videos, shows, and played skateboarding video games, but it was never
                more than an interest. Until one day I decided I wanted to land an Ollie.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you know nothing about skateboarding, every (modern) skateboarder ever, whether it’s a pro, a guy in
                the park, or a kid in the driveway, each of them HAD to land an Ollie. It’s honestly a rite-of-passage
                amongst skateboarders because any skateboarder will understand exactly what it means to land an Ollie.
                So why is the Ollie so significant? Because it’s literally just jumping with your skateboard!
            </p>
            <p>
                This makes the Ollie the basis for every modern day trick, just getting the board into the air! It
                sounds simple enough, but the technique involved is not natural, intuitive, or even fully understood,
                and failure is absolutely involved in learning it! This is because the finesse and timing is different
                for everyone, thus requiring MANY attempts before landing an Ollie, and you're going to hit the ground a
                few times in the process!
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, I definitely earned a few scars as a testament to the effort, but when I landed it, I let
                out a LOUD yell of success!! No one was around to see it (to my knowledge), but I still remember it to
                this day! Since then, I’ve had no desire to go pro (maybe one day), and I still don’t skateboard much,
                but what I did was enough to satisfy my skateboarder desires. At least for now!
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some videos I watched while learning to Ollie…

        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                This project is ongoing since there's no defined "end." Given my current work/life/project balance,
                large artistic endeavors will be limited, so this how I envision continuing my artistic practice.
                Instead of focusing on creating a large body of interconnected drawings like in "An Ode To Dedication",
                the goal is simply spending one hour a week actively drawing.
            </p>
            <p>
                With these drawings, I could focus on anything, working purely with lines, switching to drawing
                completely freehand, explore a fleeting thought, or even staring aimlessly and drawing an abstraction.
                Whatever the choice, I'm drawing for just drawing’s sake.
            </p>
            <p>
                This gives me a format to keep drawing, but with loose guidelines so I can explore my creative mindset
                without the burden of meeting an overall goal. Hmm... But now that I think about it, wouldn't that make
                all the drawings an interconnected series??! Crap.

                The irony here is how natural of a progression it was for me. In college I always ate two sandwiches for
                lunch. Occasionally it'd be different, but sandwiches were a staple of my diet. After some time, I had
                an epiphany when I noticed some slight discomfort with eating two sandwiches. I realized I physically
                uncomfortable eating two sandwiches, so I began eat only one.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time, I had no idea this one change would result in dropping 20 pounds over 9 months!! The
                hilarious part is I didn’t even notice the weight loss until people started commenting on it. Shortly
                afterward, my pants stopped fitting properly, spurning me to continue improving my overall health!
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, as I write this, I can say I'm in the best shape of my life, and I aim to keep it that way as
                long as possible! :)

            I have a lot of interests, so what I'm most interested in will likely change over time, but my time with
            each of them will certainly be valued for their provided experience.

        <h3>Drawing</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                My obsession with drawing started out like anything else, a strong desire to eliminate my boredom from
                a really boring class in my college Freshman year. My professor droned on about a topic that didn't
                mentally stimulate me, and in that state, to avoid falling asleep, I began to doodling anything in the
                classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with an outline of the ceiling projector, and it progressed to drawing each connection at the
                back of the projector. From there, I moved upward, drawing the ceiling mount, then moved further out to
                get each ceiling tile. I kept at it, capturing my perspective of the projector as best I could, and
                before I knew it, the class was over.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a moment of awakening for me as I thought, “Why not take an art class?” realizing anything that
                could hold my attention the way drawing did, is at least worth looking into. After that, I took my first
                art class my Sophomore fall semester, another the following spring, declared my Studio Art major at the
                end of that year, and never looked back!

        <a name="Music"></a>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                I don’t remember exactly when I started to love music, but it’s always been part of my life. My musical
                preferences have changed with the years, but music itself holds a draw I never tire of feeling. Whether
                for its beat, the chorus, or simply being catchy to the ear, I still remember feeling joy of hearing my
                first <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC5ca6Hsb2Q" target="_blank">favorite song</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, this love matured into understanding a songs meaning, the lyrics telling a story,
                teaching a lesson, or portraying an experience. It was new, and gave me a new reason for keeping my ears
                tuned into a song, listening to it intently, instead of merely hearing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                My biggest musical leap occurred not when I thought about a songs construction, but when I began
                relating to a songs message. Songs began perfectly explaining my feelings, be it <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpwHB2U3J1s" target="_blank">regret</a>, <a

                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7ZbM7ak8uw" target="_blank">ambition</a>. This
                drove a newfound appreciation of past songs, finding a greater meaning in some as I was now able to
                truly comprehend the musician's message.

                Music has been my escape throughout my life, providing whatever I’m looking for, time and time again,
                and for that, it has my eternal love! :)

        <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                My interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank">Cloud
                Computing</a> was sudden, but distinct and immediately enthralling. My role at work was shifted from
                being a Software Developer, to DevOpts member. I was moved because my team lead was bringing in a new
                coder, and I volunteered to make space on the team for them (the room was already cramped enough!)
            </p>
            <p>
                Joining the DevOpts team started off puzzling, as I had to learn a new set of tools on the <a
                    href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS platform</a>, but with each passing day, I found
                myself continuously drawn into Cloud Computing services. Whereas before I had to learn how to code
                buttons, levers, and switches, with AWS the level of abstraction stopped at already predefined buttons,
                levers, and switches.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that distinction, I realized what could be done with AWS was (in a way) far smaller than what could
                be done with code, and it provided me with a base on which I was truly comfortable. It was freedom to
                create something, minus being bogged down in details of how everything worked. Learning AWS has been a
                joy, and the experience is only getting better as I put more time into grasping everything it can do!

        <a name="Shell-Commands"></a>
        <h3>Shell Commands</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Now I know what you’re thinking, “Who DOESN’T love shell commands?!” and I’m right there with you!
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell" target="_blank">Shell commands</a> are the
                greatest. Thing. On. EARTH! You get immediate feedback, the commands are (usually) always the same, and
                they’re purely functional! What’s not to love about that? Seriously, I fail to understand how everybody
                doesn’t love using a Shell in their day-to-day life (convenience be damned).
            </p>
            <p>
                But seriously, the immediate-response-like nature of a Shell gives me an odd rare joy. If I have an
                automation problem, need to test some basic functionality, or even if I want to be lazy with the setup
                of my environment, the Shell provides joy to my solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I could, I’d work in a Shell for everything I’d ever need to do! I legitimately mean that. Plus, I
                feel like you look like a genius when you doing everything from a Shell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having said all that, if you don't know what a Shell is in relation to computers/programming, don't
                worry about it, just know I think they're awesome!

                I love basketball (any <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIyp86nO650" target="_blank">James
                Harden</a> fans?).
                The irony here is, as a kid, I had no interest in basketball, or sports for that matter. Initially,
                sports weren't worth watching when I could play video games (that’s all I did until college), but
                oh how times have changed! (I also watch
                <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/League%20of%20Legends" target="_blank">League of
                    Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Apex%20Legends" target="_blank">Apex
                Legends</a> on Twitch)
            </p>
            <p>
                Basketball is awesome! It’s competitive! It’s constant entertainment! Sports are all about who can
                physically and mentally perform at the absolute highest levels, against others who are doing the same,
                and still come out on top!
            </p>
            <p>
                After watching basketball for a few years now, it's easier to push myself harder to achieve my desires.
                Seeing what players have done, sticking to their passions for years, grinding day in and day out,
                putting in hour after hour of work, sweat, blood, and tears, I decided I have no excuse for not trying
                to do the same!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have no delusions of being a NBA Superstar, but seeing the drive of others keeps me going. That’s why
                I love basketball.

                So you know when you’re in a coffee shop, maybe to meet a friend, or to get your morning cup of Joe, and
                while you wait, you look around and see that guy sitting at a window, fingers interlaced beneath his
                chin, staring aimlessly out the window? That’s me. And my day isn’t complete without a daydream. (<a

            </p>
            <p>
                Since I was a child, daydreaming has been natural for me. I’d always stare out the car window on long
                drives, looking at the clouds, street lights, trees, cows, grass, or even other cars. Anything on the
                other side of the window was more interesting than what was within 3 feet of me, and it remains the same
                over 20 years later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even as I type this, I find myself constantly looking at this tree in front of me, the apartment
                building to my left, or the clouds in the sky. They’re just there, a part of the world, but in the
                background of our daily lives, and by acknowledging their presence, I’m giving them life and meaning.

                It's ironic that I work in tech, but have no desire to have friendships based solely on online
                interactions. I need to see people! I need to talk to them, learn their mannerisms, sense of humor, and
                even if they can convey their thoughts! And with more and more social interactions happening online,
                board games are the perfect medium for giving people an outlet to communicate with one another in

            <p>
                They’re fun, give people something to talk about, show how others interact with friends/strangers, and

        <h3>Dungeons and Dragons</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                I have a theory <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons</a> is going to
                experience a resurgence (if it hasn’t already) because of it’s inherent social requirements. More people
                (but not all) have more social connections through online interactions, but we aren’t programmed that
                way, we need other people in our lives! And Dungeons and Dragons gives people (like myself) an outlet to
                be creative and interact with others in a truly unique way!
            </p>
            <p>
                We can choose our gender, race, abilities, background story, friends, interactions, feelings to events,
                where to go, and how we want to get there, while belonging to a party with a thirst for adventure! It
                sounds like an amazing online experience, but it’s beauty is it’s all in-person, in real-time, with real
                (albeit "fantasy-real") consequences! And when the game is over, you just start a new campaign with a
                new character!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you haven’t played Dungeons and Dragons before, and you’re interested, I highly implore you to check
                it out! If you got the right group of people, it can be a lot of fun!
            </p>

        <h3>Coffee Shops</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                What can I say about coffee shops? They’re cool, they’re busy, but most of all, they have the perfect
                vibe for getting work done. Most of this website (I’d say 99%) was thought about, planned,
                outlined, written, implemented, and deployed in a coffee shop somewhere in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s a place with the perfect blend of social activity, and social isolation that lets me be in the
                presence of other people, without needing to explicitly interact with them. It makes it easier for me to
                focus on what I need to get done, while feeling like I belong somewhere (and I mean that in a
                non-depressed way). You’d know what I mean if you’ve never been able to get work done in a library.
            </p>
            <p>
                While providing all that, they also have food so I don’t need to leave if I have a long list of stuff to
                complete. The coffee provides the minimal amount of caffeine I need to get fully focused on completing
                my agenda. And, most importantly, they always have internet access available I can use to listen to
                music while I get my work done! (I am listening to this <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrbM1l_BoI" target="_blank">song</a> right now)
            </p>
            <p>
                Truth be told, if it’s a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, between 9am-7pm, there’s a very good chance I’m in
                a coffee shop somewhere (I’ve actually grown fond of the smell of coffee too).

        <h3>Houston Start</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                I was born in Houston, Texas, living with my 3 siblings and parents. Growing up the 2nd youngest, my dad
                always said I was different from my siblings because “You were always focused. I don’t know what it was,
                but you could see it.” (I think I know what he means now). I usually played video games most of the day,
                and riding my bike around the nearby park was a constant joy. I always had a curiosity for new places
                and things, wanting to see what else the world had.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sadly, those opportunities were rare in my childhood because of a burden that couldn’t be avoided.
                Growing up, my father had two jobs, one was a day job, and the other was early in the morning throwing
                newspapers, but it wasn’t only “his” job, it was the family job.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throwing newspapers, you get paid by papers delivered, instead of hours worked, and when you have 4 kids
                who can help, you can deliver a lot of newspapers! That’s not a knock against my parents, it’s just what
                was needed for our family to live, and I’m thankful for the experience as it made me no stranger to
                working hard at something I didn’t enjoy. It has served me well, but it wasn’t without it’s drawbacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Friendly sleepovers never happened, staying up late playing games was uncommon, or just doing whatever
                kids do (honest question, what do they do?) And through all my life before college, we only had 3 family
                vacations longer than 3 days. I never “went out” while growing up (if that was a thing). I couldn’t hang
                out with friends late into the evening at their place. I couldn't stay late at parties. I couldn't be
                out late at card shops. I just couldn't do much, although I did get the night off after my high school
                graduation, so that was something.
            </p>
            <p>
                In retrospect, I’m thankful for avoiding all the teenage stuff because those night activities don’t
                interest me even now, though I do feel I missed out on something common for everyone else. Still, making
                friends was hard when I was younger as I always felt constraints on me to figure out who I was, making
                it hard to connect with others.

        <a name="Beloit-College"></a>
        <h3>Beloit College</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Going to Beloit College was by far one of the best things I’ve ever done with my life, right next
                deciding I was going to be a good person. There was so much that went into my experience of going here,
                that to write it all down would take building another site with chapters for each year. It was
                everything I was looking for in a college, and it’ll always have a tender place in my heart for the
                memories and friends I made there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only reason I found out about Beloit College was because my Calculus teacher from high school told
                me about it, and she only told me about it because she read about it in a book about “Colleges that
                change your mind about college”. Me, being the unaware high school student I was, thought, “I’ll apply”
                without much thought afterward, knowing only that it was in Wisconsin and not in Texas. That was really
                my whole decision-making process for picking a college, that it was outside of Houston (or Texas).
            </p>
            <p>
                I had little desire to go where I knew my friends were going because I wanted to see more of the world,
                to go somewhere truly different, and to finally escape needing to deliver newspapers. I only applied to
                Houston schools to make sure I got in somewhere. After getting accepted, and seeing their generous
                financial aid package, I immediately chose Beloit College, blindly go somewhere I had never been, and I
                literally mean that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew nothing about Beloit College other than what I read about it online, their school website, and
                the acceptance package I received in the mail. I had received an invitation to visit the campus, but was
                already visiting another college the same weekend as their retreat, so the first time I saw the campus
                was the day I arrived before orientation. When I later told people about this, they were amazed I could
                do something like that given I would be there for four years, but it never really fazed me.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I said, my only concern was the college being outside Houston, other than that, I knew I could work
                with my situation wherever I went. I still feel that way too, and I think it has served me well thus
                far!
            </p>

        <a name="Baltimore-Jump"></a>
        <h3>Baltimore Jump</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Before my decision to move to Baltimore, I lived my life like I was on train, sitting down as I moved
                from event to event with little effort. I was a child, I went to elementary school, then middle school,
                followed by high school, and rounding it out with college. Going to Baltimore was the first real
                instance when I truly grasped the understanding of, “I can do anything I want.” and more than that, “I
                can do it however I wanted.” It was an amazing feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole reason I moved there was because my best friend and I made an agreement our senior year at
                Beloit that wherever he went to graduate school, I’d move there, and if he didn’t get into graduate
                school, he’d move to Houston with me. He would eventually get accepted at Johns Hopkins and, being true
                to my word, I moved out there on October 3rd of 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
                The crazy thing about moving there was my plan (or rather my lack of one) on how I did it. I had no
                place lined up. I had no job lined up. I barely had money to fund myself while there. The only thing I
                had was my best friend, which I think is the only reason I was able to pull off such a (in hindsight)
                reckless move. I was on foodstamps for the first few months because I had no income. I lived off beans
                and rice because it was cheap. And I took the first job offer I could get, which was thankfully a tech
                company.
            </p>
            <p>
                The timing of getting that job couldn’t have been better either because 1 month after I started, my
                funds were completely dried up, I had less than 100 dollars in my account, and I had to begin paying my
                student loans (like many others my age). It was definitely a stressful (and fun) time of my life, but it
                was a truly unique experience to move there with almost nothing, and working my way up to having a place
                of my own, with a fridge full of food!
            </p>
        </div>
        <a name="Portland-Adventure"></a>
        <h3>Portland Adventure</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                My need for adventure was 90% of the reason why I decided to move to Portland, OR. As I said before, I
                moved to Baltimore as part of my agreement with my best friend, but I had no intention of settling
                there, so I always had a desire to leave at some point. I choose Portland to move to because I was
                originally going to transfer to the Portland office of the company I was working for. Sadly, that didn’t
                pan out because I was laid off 2 months before my intended departure, but since I was already getting
                out my current lease, and looking at places to live there, I figured, “Why not move to Portland?” and so
                I did!
            </p>
            <p>
                My original plan wasn’t too much of a plan. I was intending on doing the same thing I had done when I
                moved to Baltimore, which was to go there with no job or place lined out, and figure it out as I went,
                with the key difference this time being I didn’t have a friend to stay with while out there. I must
                admit, this adventure of mine didn’t pan out quite how I would have like. Suffice it to say, this
                adventure was a failure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not having a job lined up was perhaps the biggest issue I faced while in Portland because of the obvious
                financial strain I was under. Having to still pay my student loans, buy food, pay rent for the places I
                was staying at (through Airbnb), and the couple times I would travel to interviews (with Uber or Lyft),
                made being there quite difficult. Truth be told, I didn’t get to do too much in Portland except for the
                occasional movie or dinner, but my overall experience was certainly pleasant.

        <h3>Houston Return</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Moving back to Houston (or even Texas for that matter) was, in a way, a unique experience that I wasn’t
                expecting. I mean, I once lived here before going to Beloit, and before moving to Baltimore, but moving
                back after being mostly away for the previous 8 years was it’s own form of culture shock. I had lost
                touch with a lot of friends from high school, and the reality I faced was I didn’t really have any
                friends there anymore. There were some I wished to remain in contact with, but they felt too distant at
                this point for me to really feel comfortable with contacting.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the first time in a long time, I felt a sense of loneliness, despite being surrounded by my family
                the whole time. I went through some moments of depression, though I mentally remained steadfast knowing
                any episode of depression was only temporary. After the first 2 weeks of being home passed, I felt
                myself accepting of my circumstances, and simply moved forward with doing what I could with my life as I
                had always done. Was it sad to let go of friends I had once been so close with? Yeah, totally, but I
                still enjoy the memories we had, and I think that’s the important part to me, I feel no animosity toward
                any of them for what hands life dealt us.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, I continued my job search in Houston, or anywhere nearby, really trying to get any job that
                would accept me (yeah, that’s what I did). I read before that you should only apply to jobs you want to
                do, but I think anyone who has been unemployed for 7 months reaches a point where being picky begins to
                be detrimental. The funny thing is that the only thing I look for in a job is if I can work with the
                people I need to work with. Anything other than that, I truly feel I can learn to do it as required.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is how I ended up accepting a job in San Antonio, even though my responsibilities would be truly
                different from what I had done before professionally. I would need to learn all new tech and skills, in
                a new work environment, in a new city, with all new coworkers. It was slightly intimidating at first,
                but I’ve always been quick to ask questions and willing to admit when I can be better at something.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being in San Antonio has been enjoyable so far, and the new job is coming to me slowly, but surely, and
                eventually I know I’ll succeed at my endeavors in learning all these new things.

            <li> PREAMBLE

                <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
                    functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
                    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
                    with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
                    Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
                    to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
                    for modifications made by others.
                </p>
                <p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
                    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
                    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
                    license designed for free software.
                </p>
                <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
                    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
                    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
                    software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
                    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
                    whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
                    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
                <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
                    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
                    distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
                    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
                    work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”, below,
                    refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
                    licensee, and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you
                    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
                    under copyright law.
                </p>
                <p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
                    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
                    modifications and/or translated into another language.
                </p>
                <p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
                    of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
                    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
                    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
                    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
                    part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
                    any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
                    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
                    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
                    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
                    that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
                    section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
                    allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
                    Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
                    Sections then there are none.
                </p>
                <p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
                    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
                    the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
                    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
                </p>
                <p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
                    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
                    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
                    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
                    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
                    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
                    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
                    to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
                    format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
                    or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
                    An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
                    of text. A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.
                </p>
                <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
                    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
                    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
                    DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
                    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples
                    of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
                    JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
                    read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
                    XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
                    not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
                    PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
                    output purposes only.
                </p>
                <p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
                    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
                    this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
                    formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
                    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title,
                    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
                </p>
                <p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
                    of the Document to the public.
                </p>
                <p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
                    title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
                    text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
                    specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
                    “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve the Title”
                    of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
                    section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.
                </p>
                <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
                    states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
                    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
                    License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
                    implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
                    no effect on the meaning of this License.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> VERBATIM COPYING

                <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
                    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
                    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
                    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
                    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
                    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
                    copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
                    compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
                    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
                </p>
                <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
                    you may publicly display copies.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

                <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
                    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
                    Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
                    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
                    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
                    the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
                    you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
                    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
                    visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
                    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
                    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
                    as verbatim copying in other respects.
                </p>
                <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
                    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
                    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
                    pages.
                </p>
                <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
                    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
                    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
                    a computer-network location from which the general network-using
                    public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
                    a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
                    If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
                    when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
                    that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
                    location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
                    Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
                    edition to the public.
                </p>
                <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
                    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
                    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> MODIFICATIONS

                <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
                    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
                    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
                    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
                    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
                    of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
                        from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
                        (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
                        of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
                        if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

                    </li>
                    <li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
                        responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
                        Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
                        Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
                        unless they release you from this requirement.

                    </li>
                    <li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
                        Modified Version, as the publisher.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

                    </li>
                    <li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
                        adjacent to the other copyright notices.

                    </li>
                    <li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
                        giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
                        terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
                        and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.

                    </li>
                    <li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
                        to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
                        publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
                        there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
                        stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
                        given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
                        Version as stated in the previous sentence.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
                        public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
                        the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
                        it was based on. These may be placed in the “History” section.
                        You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
                        least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
                        publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

                    </li>
                    <li> For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
                        the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
                        substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
                        dedications given therein.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
                        unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers
                        or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

                    </li>
                    <li> Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section
                        may not be included in the Modified Version.

                    </li>
                    <li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
                        to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
                    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
                    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
                    of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
                    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice.
                    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
                </p>
                <p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
                    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
                    parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
                    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
                    standard.
                </p>
                <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
                    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
                    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
                    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
                    through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
                    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
                    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
                    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
                    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
                </p>
                <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
                    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
                    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

                <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
                    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
                    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
                    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
                    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
                    license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
                </p>
                <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
                    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
                    copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
                    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
                    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
                    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
                    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
                    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
                </p>
                <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
                    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
                    “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
                    and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all
                    sections Entitled “Endorsements.”
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

                <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
                    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
                    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
                    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
                    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
                </p>
                <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
                    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
                    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
                    other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

                <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
                    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
                    distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
                    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
                    of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
                    When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
                    apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
                    derivative works of the Document.
                </p>
                <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
                    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
                    the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on
                    covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
                    electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
                    Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
                    aggregate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> TRANSLATION

                <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
                    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
                    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
                    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
                    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
                    original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
                    translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
                    Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
                    the original English version of this License and the original versions
                    of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
                    the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
                    or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
                </p>
                <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
                    “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
                    its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
                    title.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> TERMINATION

                <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
                    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
                    will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                </p>
                <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
                    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
                    unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
                    terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
                    fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
                    60 days after the cessation.
                </p>
                <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
                    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
                    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
                    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
                    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
                    your receipt of the notice.
                </p>
                <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
                    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
                    this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
                    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
                    not give you any rights to use it.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

                <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
                    of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
                    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
                    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
                    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_blank">https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
                    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
                    License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
                    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
                    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
                    Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
                    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
                    as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
                    specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
                    License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a
                    version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
                    Document.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> RELICENSING

                <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
                    World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
                    provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
                    public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
                    “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
                    site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
                    site.
                </p>
                <p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
                    license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
                    corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
                    California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
                    published by that same organization.
                </p>
                <p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
                    in part, as part of another Document.
                </p>
                <p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
                    License, and if all works that were first published under this License
                    somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
                    or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
                    and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
                </p>
                <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
                    under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
                    provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        <h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

        <p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
            the License in the document and put the following copyright and
            license notices just after the title page:
        </p>
        <div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  Copyright (C)  <var>2018</var>  <var>Don Robles</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
            replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:
        </p>
        <div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
            combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
            situation.
        </p>
        <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
            recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
            free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
            to permit their use in free software.
