    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <div class="passage" id="content-Introduction">
        <p>
            I sat in front of my computer for the better part of an hour, trying to figure out how to start my
            introduction, until I decided to just start typing, and see where it goes.
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Don Robles, and if you’re here, I imagine you’d like to know more about me. Well, I’m happy to
            report you’ve come to the right place, after all, this is my website! I usually don’t take many things
            seriously (mainly myself), except for what needs serious attention (like myself), and I like to think this
            site will reflect that. Maybe. I’m not sure yet. Part of me wants it to focus solely on my skills,
            portraying me as a professional with desires to accomplish everything I set my mind to. The other part kinda
            just wants to finish this thing because it’s been on my to-do list for a more than a few years!</p>
        <p>
            In the end, both those tracks of thought convey who I am to a T (why is that a phrase? “To a T”?) because
            for
            better or worse I’m both those people, and without one of them, I wouldn’t be me1. I say that because my two
            greatest passions, thus far in my short life, are building things, and solving problems. These two joys are
            at the
            base of everything I deem worthwhile undertaking.
        </p>
        <p>
            These joys are my guide in what I do due to the nature of their interaction within myself. I want to solves
            problems like a coder, breaking them down into bite size pieces, addressing each of them until the full
            solution is implemented, while my desire to build and create influences how the problem is solved. I’d find
            myself pulling from my past experiences, building with previous code pieces I created, putting them together
            into a unique solution that would serve me again in the future.</p>
        <p>
            In layman’s terms, I’m a coder, and an artist. A professional, while being a silly guy, or as I like to put
            it, I’m a focused individual with a carefree personality. There was a time when I thought I had to drop one
            part of myself to focus solely on the other, but I’ve since learned they’re intrinsically linked to who I
            am, and I’m destined to continue the struggle of satiating both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mean, honestly, it’s not that hard, and I rather enjoy it too as it keeps life fresh for me. One day I’ll
            be in a bout of solving life’s greatest problems, while another I’m furiously scribbling away in my
            sketchbook. Maybe one day I’ll truly let one go (I doubt it), but until then, I know I’ll always have
            something to keep
            my days occupied!
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy what you learn about me! (I promise, I’m cooler in person!)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Don Robles</b>
        </p>

            PS: Do you know “PS” stands for “Post Script”? There’s your fun fact of the day!

    <h2>2. Hobbies/Interests</h2>
    <div class="passage" id="content-Hobbies-Interests">
        <p>
            I have a lot of interests, but really only 2 worth mentioning.
        </p>
        <a name="Drawing"></a>
        <h3>Drawing</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                My obsession with drawing started out like anything else, a strong desire to get rid of my boredom. The
                boredom was due to being in a less-than-stimulating class my Freshman year of college. My professor
                droned on and on about a topic that did nothing for me personally, and in that state, with a need to
                avoid falling asleep, I began to doodle anything I could see in the class.
            </p>
            <p>
                It started with an outline of the ceiling projector, catching its curves as best as I can, and it
                progressed to outlining each connection available behind the projector. From there, I found my way
                upward, drawing the ceiling mount, and even further from there getting each ceiling tile. I kept at it,
                making sure to capture the perspective of my view of the projector as best I could, and before I knew
                it, the class was over.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a moment of awakening for me as I thought, “Why not take an art class?” realizing anything that
                could hold my attention the way drawing did, is at least worth looking into. After that, I took my first
                art class in the fall semester of my sophomore year, another the following spring, declared my Studio
                Art major at the end of the year, and have never looked back since.
            </p>
        </div>
        <a name="Music"></a>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                I don’t remember the exact moment I started to love music, but it’s always been a part of my life. Even
                though my musical preferences have changed with the years, music itself has held a draw I never get
                tired of
                feeling. Whether it was because of its beat, the chorus, or simply being catchy to the ear, my love of
                music
                started with simply feeling joy of hearing my (at the time) <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC5ca6Hsb2Q" target="_blank">favorite song</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, this love matured into understanding the meaning of songs, hearing the lyrics tell a
                story,
                teach a lesson, or portray an experience. It was new for me, and it gave me a new reason for keeping my
                ears
                tuned into a song, listening to it intently than merely hearing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest leap that occurred for me musically wasn’t when I began to think about the construction of a
                song, but when I began relating to what they were saying. There were songs perfectly explaining what I
                felt,
                be it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpwHB2U3J1s" target="_blank">regret</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXYdObL6Cw8" target="_blank">anger</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml5RhkyKXyc" target="_blank">relief</a>,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKNxeF4KMsY" target="_blank">excitement</a>, or <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7ZbM7ak8uw" target="_blank">ambition</a> to do more. This
                drove me to a
                newfound
                appreciation of songs from my past, finding a greater meaning in some of them as I was now able to truly
                comprehend what the artist was saying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Music has been an escape for me throughout my life, providing me whatever I’m looking for, time and time
                again.

        <a name="Cloud-Computing"></a>
        <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                My interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank">Cloud
                Computing</a> was sudden,
                but
                distinct and immediately enthralling to me. While working on a company project, my role was shifted from
                project coder, to company DevOpts team member. I was moved because being open to learning new things,
                and
                the team lead wanted to bring on a new coder to the team, I volunteered to make space on the team for
                them
                (the room was already at capacity).
            </p>
            <p>
                Joining the DevOpts team started off puzzling, as I had to learn a wide variety of tools in the <a
                    href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS platform</a>, but with each passing day, I found
                myself
                continuously
                drawn into the world of Cloud Computing. Whereas before I had to learn how to code buttons, levers, and
                switches, with AWS the level of abstraction stopped at already predefined buttons, levers, and switches.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that distinction, I learned the possibilities of what could be done with AWS were far smaller than
                what
                could be done with code, and it provided me with a base on which I was truly comfortable. Freedom to
                create
                something, but without being bogged down in the details of how everything works. Learning AWS has been a
                joy, and the experience is only getting better as I put more time into grasping everything it can do!
            </p>
        </div>
        <a name="Shell-Commands"></a>
        <h3>Shell Commands</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Now I know what you’re thinking, “Who DOESN’T love for shell commands?!” and I’m right there with you!
                <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell" target="_blank">Shell commands</a> are the
                greatest. Thing. On.
                EARTH!
                They give you immediate feedback, the commands are always the same, and, get this, they’re purely
                functional! What’s not to like about that? Seriously, I fail to understand how everybody doesn’t love
                using
                a Shell in their day-to-day life (convenience be damned).
            </p>
            <p>
                But seriously, the immediate-response-like nature of a shell gives me a joy I rarely find. If I have an
                automation problem, need to test some basic functionality, or even if I want to be lazy with the setup
                of my
                environment, the shell provides the joy to the solution I implement.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I could, I’d work in a shell for everything I’d ever need to do! I legitimately mean that. Plus, I
                feel like you look like a genius when you doing everything from a shell.

        <h3>Basketball</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                I love basketball (any <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIyp86nO650" target="_blank">James
                Harden</a> fans?).
                That’s
                funny to write because as a kid, I had absolutely no interest in basketball, or even sports. To my
                younger
                self, sports weren’t worth watching when I could play video games (that’s all I did until college), but
                oh
                how times have changed! (I also watch <a
                    href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/League%20of%20Legends" target="_blank">League
                of Legends on Twitch</a>)
            </p>
            <p>
                Basketball is awesome! It’s competitive! It’s constant entertainment! Sports are all about who can
                physically and mentally perform at the absolute highest levels, against others who are doing the same,
                and
                still come out on top!
            </p>
            <p>
                After watching basketball for a few years now, I’ve found it easier to push myself harder and harder to
                achieve my desires. Seeing what others have done, sticking to their passions for year after year,
                grinding
                day in and day out, putting in hour after hour of work, sweat, blood, and tears, I decided I have no
                excuse
                for trying to do the same!
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why I love basketball.

            <p>
                So you know when you’re in a coffee shop, maybe to meet a friend, or maybe to get your morning cup of
                Joe,
                and while you wait, you look around and see that guy sitting at a window sill, his fingers interlaced
                beneath his chin, staring aimlessly out the window? That’s me. And my day isn’t complete without a
                daydream.
                (<a href="https://proveedoreshosteltur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/graphicstock-handsome-man-walking-on-street-and-chatting-by-his-phone-outdoors-while-drinking-coffee-look-at-phone_rIqlYIvXd2l-e1508493523705.jpg"
                    target="_blank">you’ll
                rarely see me like this</a>)
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I was a child, daydreaming has been natural and innate to me. I’d always stare out the window on
                long
                drives, looking at the clouds, the street lights, the trees, the cows, the grass, or even the other
                cars.
                Anything that was on the other side of that window was more interesting to me than what was within 3
                feet of
                me, and it remains the same over 20 years later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even now as I type this, I find myself constantly looking at this tree in front of me, the apartment
                building to my left, or the clouds in the sky. They’re just there, apart of the world, but in the
                background
                of our daily lives, and by acknowledging its presence, I’m giving it life and meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, daydreaming, it’s cool to me. <a

                I find it ironic that as much as I work in tech, I have no desire to have friendships that are based
                purely
                on online interactions. I need to see you in person. I need to talk to you and learn your mannerisms,
                your
                sense of humor, and even if you can convey your thoughts! And with more and more social interactions
                happening online, board games are the perfect medium for giving people an outlet to communicate with one
                another in person!
            </p>
            <p>
                They’re fun, give people something to talk about, allow you to see how others interact with
                friends/strangers, and there’s no shortage of board game options out there! It’s because of that, I
                could
                play a different board game every week and never get tired of them! I strongly desire social contact
                with
                people in the real world, and board games are just one avenue I enjoy for that purpose.

        <h3>Dungeons and Dragons</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                I have a theory that <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons</a> is going
                to experience a
                resurgence soon (if it isn’t already) because of it’s inherent social requirements. Again, more people
                are
                getting their social connections from online interactions, but we aren’t programmed that way, we need
                other
                people in our lives! And Dungeons and Dragons gives people (like myself) an outlet to be creative and
                interact with others in a different world where we can be anything we want to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can choose our gender, race, abilities, background story, friends, interactions, feelings to events,
                where we want to go, and even how we want to get there, while belonging to a party with a thirst for
                adventure! It sounds like an amazing online experience, but it’s beauty is it’s all in-person, in
                real-time,
                with real (albeit fantasy-real) consequences! And when the game is over, you just start a new campaign
                with
                a new character!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you haven’t play Dungeons and Dragons before, and you’ve had an interested in it, I highly implore
                you to
                check it out! If you got the right group of people, it can be a lot of fun!
            </p>

        <h3>Coffee Shops</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                What can I say about coffee shops? They’re cool (that’s one), they’re busy (that’s another), but most of
                all, they have the perfect vibe I need to get work done. Most of this website (I’d say 97% of it) was
                thought about, planned, outlined, written, implemented, and deployed in a coffee shop somewhere in the
                US.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s this place with the perfect blend of social activity, and social isolation that lets me be in the
                presence of other people, without needing to explicitly interact with them. It makes it easier for me to
                focus on what I need to get done, while feeling like I belong somewhere (and I mean that in a
                non-depressed
                way). You’d know what I mean if you’ve never been able to get work done in a library.
            </p>
            <p>
                While providing all that, they also have food so I don’t need to leave if I have a long list of stuff to
                complete. The coffee provides the minimal amount of caffeine I need to get fully focused on completing
                my
                agenda. And, most importantly, they always have internet access available I can use to listen to music
                while
                I get my work done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Truth be told, if it’s a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, between the hours of 9am-7pm, there’s a very good
                chance I’m in a coffee shop somewhere (I’ve actually grown fond of the smell of coffee too).

            I've learned recently, since about 2014, I must always have a goal to work towards, otherwise I truly wont
            feel fulfilled with my time.

        <h3>Authentic Athens Marathon</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Have you ever ran a marathon? No? Keep it that way, because it was definitely the hardest thing I’ve
                done in
                my life, physically and mentally (but really, run one if you want too). The grueling experience taught
                me
                just how much effort and determination I could muster to accomplish a goal I set for myself. It required
                every ounce of my self-discipline to keep my feet moving, step after step, for what felt like an
                eternity,
                and what did I get out of it? Almost nothing, except for the brownie points of being able to say “I’ve
                ran a
                marathon.” That’s not to downplay my achievement, it’s all I really have to “show” to other people about
                my
                experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, that’s not all I gained. What I mostly gained was an understanding of the state of my mental
                fortitude for persevering when I’m under immense physical and mental stress. It has allowed me to look
                on my
                problems since then and say, “This isn’t nearly as exhausting as the marathon was, I can handle this.”
                And
                continue operating at a mental level I know I can sustain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even now when I work out, I tell myself really, really, REALLY mean things knowing the pain, soreness,
                exhaustion, and effort is nothing in comparison (it really isn’t), and I continue to push myself harder.
                I
                don’t know if I’d ever run another marathon, but it was certainly worth all the effort and training
                required
                of me to complete it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh yeah, and in case you’re wondering, I ran the Authentic Marathon in Greece on 11-12-16 with a time of
                5:04:17.

        <h3>A Year of Knod</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                In 2015, I had a realization of how unhappy I was with my current creative state-of-mind, and so set out
                to
                remedy the situation. Prior to starting this project, I attempted to do 200 drawings in a year, but
                failed
                because of creative barriers I couldn’t surpass with pure effort (I literally ran out of ideas for
                drawings). Using that experience, this project aimed to resolve the issues I had with the first project.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time, I was really interested in graffiti art, and so I knew I wanted to draw words. From there,
                I
                wrote a 52-word poem about the project itself, and the dedication required to complete the whole thing.
                I
                chose the poem to be 52 words long because my intention was to do a drawing a week, for a year, so I’d
                have
                52 drawings of words that make up a poem about the dedication required for its completion.
            </p>
            <p>
                After having the foundation of the project laid down, I officially started the project on April 27th,
                2015
                and kept up the pace of a drawing a week, for about 4 weeks!! It was lame to fall behind, but my
                determination never wavered, and after a couple life setbacks, I completed the final drawing on December
                31st, 2016. I didn’t plan it to end on the last day of the year, that was a funny coincidence, but when
                I
                saw the year coming to a close, and have only 2 drawings left to do, I stopped everything else I was
                doing
                to make sure I completed them before the year concluded.

                If you’re reading this right now, it means I finished building this site! (Seriously, I’ve been meaning
                to
                do this for a more than a few years). Granted, over those years my idea for what my site would contain
                went
                through several iterations, and technology changed the required effort for building it, so it wasn’t
                like I
                wasn’t doing anything during that time. Still, sitting down and really thinking about what I wanted this
                site to have, how I wanted it to look, the functional requirements, where it would be hosted, etc. was
                all a
                truly unique learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                And just like every learning experience, the amount of time it took to get this thing built was SO.
                MUCH.
                MORE. Than I originally thought, and I already thought it was going to take a long time! Though, I
                imagine
                working on 3 or 4 personal projects at the same time means they’re each going to take longer to
                complete,
                but that’s another learning experience I’ll take into account in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I digress, I’m glad I got this thing done, and I hope you’ve enjoyed reading through it! I focused a
                lot
                on making sure it loads quickly and works on any device you view it on, so if you happen to find an
                issue
                with it, do let me know! :)

        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                My decision to do this “tough” event was one of the more spontaneous things I’ve had the joy of doing!
                It
                all simply started when my friend on posted a question Facebook asking who wanted to do one? And me
                never
                being one to say “No” to life, said “Sure, why not?” and that was the extent of my reasoning for doing
                it!
            </p>
            <p>
                You may wonder, what’s a “Tough Mudder”? Well, it’s a 10 mile obstacle course with an obstacle at each
                half-mile mark, that each basically requires help from someone else to truly complete. That means the
                whole
                course is built on needing teamwork to get through it, with myself being on a team of 5 people, 3 of
                whom I
                never met before the event itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I trained for about 3 months to make sure I’d be in proper condition to complete the full 10 mile
                course,
                and I’m certainly glad I did because when the day of the event came, I was slightly surprised at the
                “ease”
                of it. That’s not to say I had no help! I certainly did (and it’s required on some obstacles), but the
                physical toll on my body wasn’t nearly as draining as I was anticipating.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps it was because I was accustomed to running long distances from my prior marathon? But it didn’t
                detract from my sense of accomplishment once the event was done. If you decide to do one, I highly
                recommend
                having a team of friends do it with you, that’s truly where the joy of the event lies!
            </p>

        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Since I was a kid, I’ve always had an admiration for skateboarding. I even had a skateboard, but that
                was my
                whole experience. Growing up, I’d watch guys do tricks, envying their skills and how cool they looked. I
                watched skateboarding videos, shows, and liked skateboarding video games. It never took up a lot of time
                (and still doesn’t), but it’s always been an interest I kept at arms-length for no real reason. That is,
                until one day I decided I wanted to land an Ollie.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you know nothing about skateboarding, allow me to enlighten you. Every skateboarder you see, whether
                it’s
                a pro on TV, a guy in the park, or a kid in the driveway, each of them HAD to land an Ollie. It’s
                honestly a
                right-of-passage amongst skateboarders because if you tell a skateboarder you’re trying to land an
                Ollie,
                they’ll understand exactly what you’re going through. Why did each of them have to land an Ollie?
                Because
                it’s literally just jumping with your skateboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                That makes an Ollie the basis for every modern day trick, just getting the board in the air. It sounds
                simple enough, but the technique to do so is not natural, intuitive, or even fully understood, and
                you’re
                going to fall a lot while learning. It requires a certain amount of finesse and timing that can only be
                learned with multiple attempts because you’re trying to get the board in the air, maintain control of
                it,
                and then land on it, while moving.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, I definitely earned a few scars as a testament to the effort of landing an Ollie, but the
                day I
                did, I felt a strong sense of accomplishment for doing what I set my mind to. Since then, I’ve had no
                desire
                to go pro (maybe one day), and I still don’t skateboard much, but knowing I did was enough for me to
                satisfy
                my skateboarder desires.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are some videos I watched during my progress of land an Ollie…

                So this project is actually ongoing because I don’t know exactly when it’ll end. Given my current
                work/life/project balance, I don’t have time for a large artistic endeavor, so this my answer to that.
                Rather than focus on a large project with interconnected meaning between each drawing like I did with A
                Year
                of Knod, the goal here is to simply spend one hour a week actively drawing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike my 200 Drawings in a Year project, this one is aimed purely at drawing, with no set number of
                drawings expected for completion. I could choose to focus purely on lines for one drawing, switch to
                doing
                something complete freehand, change it up for exploring an idea I had in passing, or even staring at
                some
                paper and drawing something abstract. Whatever it is I draw, my focus is purely on drawing for drawing’s
                sake.
            </p>
            <p>
                This gives me a format to keep drawing, but with loose enough guidelines that I can explore my creative
                mindset without the burden of meeting an overall goal.

                A funny irony with how I completed this was I actually didn’t try to do it (at least effort-wise). There
                was
                a time when I liked to eat a lot of food, and while in college, for lunch, I’d always eat two sandwiches
                with chips, every day. Occasionally I’d have something different, but sandwiches have always been a
                staple
                of diet since I was a kid, so it was I never got tired of them. After some time, I had what you could
                call
                an epiphany, and it was in the form of noticing I was slightly uncomfortable with eating two sandwiches.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn’t an emotional feeling, but a physical one. My stomach physically felt uncomfortable with two
                sandwiches inside it, and so I decided to just eat one sandwich for lunch instead of two. Little did I
                know
                that this one simple change in my diet would result in me dropping 20 pounds over the course of 9
                months.
                The really funny thing was that I didn’t realize I was losing weight until people started commenting how
                thin I looked. Shortly after that, my pants began to fit less and less properly, spurning me to continue
                improving my overall health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, I’ve continued improving my overall health to a place that I think is truly worth talking
                about,
                though I don’t talk about the maintenance of my weight very often.

        <h3>AWS Certification</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Right now I’d say this is my biggest interest, right after drawing. Getting my AWS Certification started
                off
                as a simple foray into what AWS could offer my team at the time, and gradually grew into a desire to
                earn
                their certification. The main reason I’m so interested in AWS is because of its inherent technical
                imitations. With coding, you could get endlessly lost in how you want to solve a problem, juggling
                solutions
                to try and find the right one. AWS doesn’t have that much complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In AWS, there’s an actual limit to everything you can know about the services because AWS is, itself, a
                potential solution to business problems. Creativity is required to determine what services you want to
                use,
                and how you want to use them, but the underlying tools themselves remain the same. One way I like to
                explain
                it is that with coding, you create buttons, levers, and dials, and with AWS you work with buttons,
                levers,
                and dials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh yeah, and I just think cloud technology is cool. There’s something intriguing to me about using a
                random
                computer node within a giant network to solve my problems. Like the problem of this hosting this
                website,
                it’s actually running on AWS right now!

        <h3>Houston Start</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                I was born in Houston, Texas where I lived with my 3 siblings and both parents. I’m the 2nd youngest and
                needless to say, I was slightly different from everyone else because, as my dad put it, “You were always
                focused on something. I don’t know what, but you could see it.” (I think I know what he means now).
                Anyway, I was also the only one who played video games most of the day, and I also enjoyed riding my
                bike around the park across the street from my house. There was always a curiosity I had for seeing new
                places or new things, I wanted to know what else the world had.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sadly, those opportunities were rare in my childhood because of a family burden that couldn’t be
                avoided. The reason for that was because my father had two jobs, one during most of the day, and the
                other was throwing newspapers during the early morning hours, but it wasn’t really “his” job, it was the
                family job.
            </p>
            <p>
                You see, you don’t get paid by the hour for delivering newspapers, you get paid by how many papers you
                deliver, and when you have 4 kids who can help you, you can deliver a lot of newspapers! Now that’s not
                a knock against my parents, it’s just what we needed to do to get through life, and I’m thankful for the
                experience because it taught me how to work long and hard at something I don’t enjoy, which has served
                me well, but it wasn’t without it’s drawbacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I mentioned earlier, I could never spend the night at friends houses to play games or do whatever
                kids do (honest question, what do they do?) And over the 18 years of life before college, we only ever
                went on 3 vacations that lasted longer than 3 days. I never got to “go out” when I was growing up. I
                couldn’t hang out with friends for long in the evening at their place. I could stay late at parties.
                There was no real night life for me as a teenager.
            </p>
            <p>
                In retrospect, I’m somewhat thankful for avoiding all that because those night activities don’t interest
                me even now, but part of me feels like I missed out on something that is common for everyone else.
                Still, I found making friends hard when I was younger because I always felt like there was some kind of
                constraints on me to figure out who I was, making it hard to connect with others.

        <h3>Beloit College</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Going to Beloit College was by far one of the best things I’ve ever done with my life, right next
                deciding I was going to be a good person. There was so much that went into my experience of going here,
                that to write it all down would take building another site with chapters for each year. It was
                everything I was looking for in a college, and it’ll always have a tender place in my heart for the
                memories and friends I made there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only reason I found out about Beloit College was because my Calculus teacher from high school told
                me about it, and she only told me about it because she read about it in a book about “Colleges that
                change your mind about college”. Me, being the unaware high school student I was, thought, “I’ll apply”
                without much thought afterward, knowing only that it was in Wisconsin and not in Texas. That was really
                my whole decision-making process for picking a college, that it was outside of Houston (or Texas).
            </p>
            <p>
                I had little desire to go where I knew my friends were going because I wanted to see more of the world,
                to go somewhere truly different, and to finally escape needing to deliver newspapers. I only applied to
                Houston schools to make sure I got in somewhere. After getting accepted, and seeing their generous
                financial aid package, I immediately chose Beloit College, blindly go somewhere I had never been, and I
                literally mean that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew nothing about Beloit College other than what I read about it online, their school website, and
                the acceptance package I received in the mail. I had received an invitation to visit the campus, but was
                already visiting another college the same weekend as their retreat, so the first time I saw the campus
                was the day I arrived before orientation. When I later told people about this, they were amazed I could
                do something like that given I would be there for four years, but it never really fazed me.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I said, my only concern was the college being outside Houston, other than that, I knew I could work
                with my situation wherever I went. I still feel that way too, and I think it has served me well thus
                far!

        <h3>Baltimore Jump</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Before my decision to move to Baltimore, I lived my life like I was on train, sitting down as I moved
                from event to event with little effort. I was a child, I went to elementary school, then middle school,
                followed by high school, and rounding it out with college. Going to Baltimore was the first real
                instance when I truly grasped the understanding of, “I can do anything I want.” and more than that, “I
                can do it however I wanted.” It was an amazing feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole reason I moved there was because my best friend and I made an agreement our senior year at
                Beloit that wherever he went to graduate school, I’d move there, and if he didn’t get into graduate
                school, he’d move to Houston with me. He would eventually get accepted at Johns Hopkins and, being true
                to my word, I moved out there on October 3rd of 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
                The crazy thing about moving there was my plan (or rather my lack of one) on how I did it. I had no
                place lined up. I had no job lined up. I barely had money to fund myself while there. The only thing I
                had was my best friend, which I think is the only reason I was able to pull off such a (in hindsight)
                reckless move. I was on foodstamps for the first few months because I had no income. I lived off beans
                and rice because it was cheap. And I took the first job offer I could get, which was thankfully a tech
                company.
            </p>
            <p>
                The timing of getting that job couldn’t have been better either because 1 month after I started, my
                funds were completely dried up, I had less than 100 dollars in my account, and I had to begin paying my
                student loans (like many others my age). It was definitely a stressful (and fun) time of my life, but it
                was a truly unique experience to move there with almost nothing, and working my way up to having a place
                of my own, with a fridge full of food!

        <h3>Portland Adventure</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                My need for adventure was 90% of the reason why I decided to move to Portland, OR. As I said before, I
                moved to Baltimore as part of my agreement with my best friend, but I had no intention of settling
                there, so I always had a desire to leave at some point. I choose Portland to move to because I was
                originally going to transfer to the Portland office of the company I was working for. Sadly, that didn’t
                pan out because I was laid off 2 months before my intended departure, but since I was already getting
                out my current lease, and looking at places to live there, I figured, “Why not move to Portland?” and so
                I did!
            </p>
            <p>
                My original plan wasn’t too much of a plan. I was intending on doing the same thing I had done when I
                moved to Baltimore, which was to go there with no job or place lined out, and figure it out as I went,
                with the key difference this time being I didn’t have a friend to stay with while out there. I must
                admit, this adventure of mine didn’t pan out quite how I would have like. Suffice it to say, this
                adventure was a failure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not having a job lined up was perhaps the biggest issue I faced while in Portland because of the obvious
                financial strain I was under. Having to still pay my student loans, buy food, pay rent for the places I
                was staying at (through Airbnb), and the couple times I would travel to interviews (with Uber or Lyft),
                made being there quite difficult. Truth be told, I didn’t get to do too much in Portland except for the
                occasional movie or dinner, but my overall experience was certainly pleasant.

        <h3>Houston Return</h3>
        <div class="passage">
            <p>
                Moving back to Houston (or even Texas for that matter) was, in a way, a unique experience that I wasn’t
                expecting. I mean, I once lived here before going to Beloit, and before moving to Baltimore, but moving
                back after being mostly away for the previous 8 years was it’s own form of culture shock. I had lost
                touch with a lot of friends from high school, and the reality I faced was I didn’t really have any
                friends there anymore. There were some I wished to remain in contact with, but they felt too distant at
                this point for me to really feel comfortable with contacting.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the first time in a long time, I felt a sense of loneliness, despite being surrounded by my family
                the whole time. I went through some moments of depression, though I mentally remained steadfast knowing
                any episode of depression was only temporary. After the first 2 weeks of being home passed, I felt
                myself accepting of my circumstances, and simply moved forward with doing what I could with my life as I
                had always done. Was it sad to let go of friends I had once been so close with? Yeah, totally, but I
                still enjoy the memories we had, and I think that’s the important part to me, I feel no animosity toward
                any of them for what hands life dealt us.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, I continued my job search in Houston, or anywhere nearby, really trying to get any job that
                would accept me (yeah, that’s what I did). I read before that you should only apply to jobs you want to
                do, but I think anyone who has been unemployed for 7 months reaches a point where being picky begins to
                be detrimental. The funny thing is that the only thing I look for in a job is if I can work with the
                people I need to work with. Anything other than that, I truly feel I can learn to do it as required.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is how I ended up accepting a job in San Antonio, even though my responsibilities would be truly
                different from what I had done before professionally. I would need to learn all new tech and skills, in
                a new work environment, in a new city, with all new coworkers. It was slightly intimidating at first,
                but I’ve always been quick to ask questions and willing to admit when I can be better at something.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being in San Antonio has been enjoyable so far, and the new job is coming to me slowly, but surely, and
                eventually I know I’ll succeed at my endeavors in learning all these new things.

                Instagram is the social media site I use most frequently. Given I love to draw, I think it makes sense.
                I never post pics of myself at different outings (concerts, family visits, etc.), it's only ever the

            <li> PREAMBLE

                <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
                    functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
                    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
                    with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
                    Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
                    to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
                    for modifications made by others.
                </p>
                <p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
                    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
                    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
                    license designed for free software.
                </p>
                <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
                    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
                    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
                    software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
                    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
                    whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
                    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
                <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
                    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
                    distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
                    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
                    work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”, below,
                    refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
                    licensee, and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you
                    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
                    under copyright law.
                </p>
                <p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
                    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
                    modifications and/or translated into another language.
                </p>
                <p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
                    of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
                    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
                    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
                    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in
                    part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
                    any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
                    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
                    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
                    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
                    that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
                    section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
                    allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
                    Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
                    Sections then there are none.
                </p>
                <p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
                    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
                    the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
                    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
                </p>
                <p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
                    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
                    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
                    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
                    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
                    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
                    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
                    to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
                    format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
                    or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
                    An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
                    of text. A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.
                </p>
                <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
                    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
                    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
                    DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
                    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples
                    of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
                    JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
                    read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
                    XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
                    not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
                    PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
                    output purposes only.
                </p>
                <p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
                    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
                    this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
                    formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
                    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title,
                    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
                </p>
                <p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
                    of the Document to the public.
                </p>
                <p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
                    title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
                    text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
                    specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
                    “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve the Title”
                    of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
                    section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.
                </p>
                <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
                    states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
                    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
                    License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
                    implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
                    no effect on the meaning of this License.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> VERBATIM COPYING

                <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
                    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
                    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
                    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
                    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
                    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
                    copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
                    compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
                    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
                </p>
                <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
                    you may publicly display copies.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

                <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
                    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
                    Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
                    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
                    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
                    the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
                    you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present
                    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
                    visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
                    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
                    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
                    as verbatim copying in other respects.
                </p>
                <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
                    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
                    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
                    pages.
                </p>
                <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
                    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
                    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
                    a computer-network location from which the general network-using
                    public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
                    a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
                    If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
                    when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
                    that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
                    location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
                    Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
                    edition to the public.
                </p>
                <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
                    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
                    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> MODIFICATIONS

                <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
                    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
                    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
                    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
                    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
                    of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
                        from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
                        (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
                        of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
                        if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

                    </li>
                    <li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
                        responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
                        Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
                        Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
                        unless they release you from this requirement.

                    </li>
                    <li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
                        Modified Version, as the publisher.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

                    </li>
                    <li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
                        adjacent to the other copyright notices.

                    </li>
                    <li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
                        giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
                        terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
                        and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.

                    </li>
                    <li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
                        to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
                        publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
                        there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
                        stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
                        given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
                        Version as stated in the previous sentence.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
                        public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
                        the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
                        it was based on. These may be placed in the “History” section.
                        You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
                        least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
                        publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

                    </li>
                    <li> For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
                        the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
                        substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
                        dedications given therein.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
                        unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers
                        or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

                    </li>
                    <li> Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section
                        may not be included in the Modified Version.

                    </li>
                    <li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
                        to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

                    </li>
                    <li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
                    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
                    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
                    of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
                    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice.
                    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
                </p>
                <p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
                    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
                    parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
                    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
                    standard.
                </p>
                <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
                    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
                    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
                    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
                    through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
                    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
                    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
                    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
                    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
                </p>
                <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
                    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
                    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

                <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
                    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
                    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
                    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
                    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
                    license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
                </p>
                <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
                    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
                    copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
                    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
                    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
                    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
                    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
                    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
                </p>
                <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
                    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
                    “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
                    and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all
                    sections Entitled “Endorsements.”
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

                <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
                    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
                    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
                    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
                    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
                </p>
                <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
                    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
                    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
                    other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

                <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
                    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
                    distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
                    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
                    of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
                    When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
                    apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
                    derivative works of the Document.
                </p>
                <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
                    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
                    the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on
                    covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
                    electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
                    Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
                    aggregate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> TRANSLATION

                <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
                    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
                    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
                    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
                    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
                    original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
                    translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
                    Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
                    the original English version of this License and the original versions
                    of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between
                    the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
                    or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
                </p>
                <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
                    “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
                    its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
                    title.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> TERMINATION

                <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
                    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
                    will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                </p>
                <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
                    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
                    unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
                    terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
                    fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
                    60 days after the cessation.
                </p>
                <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
                    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
                    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
                    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
                    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
                    your receipt of the notice.
                </p>
                <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
                    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
                    this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
                    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
                    not give you any rights to use it.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

                <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
                    of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
                    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
                    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
                    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_blank">https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
                    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
                    License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
                    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
                    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
                    Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
                    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
                    as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document
                    specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
                    License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a
                    version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
                    Document.
                </p>

            <li> RELICENSING

                <p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
                    World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
                    provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
                    public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
                    “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
                    site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
                    site.

                    corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,

                    published by that same organization.

                <p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
                    License, and if all works that were first published under this License
                    somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
                    or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
                    and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
                </p>
                <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
                    under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
                    provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        <p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of

        <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,

        <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
            combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
            situation.
